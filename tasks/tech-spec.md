# Tech Spec: Blab

> **Scope:** how we build Blab. The *what* lives in [`prd-blab.md`](./prd-blab.md) — that PRD is the source of truth for product behavior. This document only covers technology, architecture, and engineering conventions. If the two disagree on product behavior, the PRD wins; if they disagree on tech choices, this spec wins.

---

## Stack

- **Framework:** Flutter (stable channel), Dart 3+
- **Targets:** Android first, iOS second
  - Phase 1: Android-only builds, ship to physical device + emulator
  - Phase 2: iOS parity — no Android-only APIs without an iOS equivalent path
- **Single codebase, single design system** — see § Design Fidelity below

---

## Platform Targets

| Platform | Phase | Min version | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Android  | 1     | API 24 (Android 7.0) | Covers ~97% of devices |
| iOS      | 2     | iOS 14      | Matches Flutter's current minimum |

Rationale: the PRD calls for an "iOS-native feel" but we ship Android first. We keep the iOS look across both platforms (purple brand, rounded corners, bottom sheets, system fonts) rather than adapting to Material on Android. This is a product choice from `prd-blab.md` § Design Principles, not a Flutter constraint.

## Project Layout

```
lib/
  main.dart                  // app entry, theme, root router
  app/
    router.dart              // route definitions (one route per PRD flow)
    theme.dart               // colors, typography, radii — pulled from prototype.html
  features/
    auth/                    // Flow 1 (US-001…US-005)
    chats/                   // Flow 2 (US-006…US-012)
    chat/                    // Flow 3 + 4 chat surface (US-013…US-023, US-028)
    invite/                  // Flow 4 invite landing + join (US-024…US-027)
    profile/                 // Profile, Edit profile, Change password (US-010…US-012)
  shared/
    widgets/                 // BottomSheet, TappableWord, ReadReceipts, etc.
    models/
    services/                // api, storage, auth client
  l10n/                      // interface language strings (FR-3)

integration_test/
android/
ios/
```

One folder per PRD flow. Each feature folder owns its widgets, state, and screen files; cross-feature widgets live under `shared/widgets`.

---

## State Management

**Decision: Riverpod** (`flutter_riverpod`). Locked 2026-05-25.

Conventions:
- Use `riverpod_generator` + `riverpod_annotation` for codegen — typed providers, no string keys.
- Group providers by feature folder (`features/<flow>/providers/`), not centrally.
- Notifier classes for mutable state; `Provider` / `FutureProvider` / `StreamProvider` for derived/async.
- No `BuildContext`-passing for state. No `ChangeNotifier` mixed in.

State scoping rule from the PRD: **Phone 3 and Phone 4 keep separate translation-toggle state** (FR-23). In Flutter terms, the "show translations" flag is per-chat — model as a `NotifierProvider.family<bool, ChatId>` (or equivalent codegen form), never a global setting.

---

## Navigation

- **`go_router`** for declarative routes, deep links (needed for invite links — US-024), and nested navigation
- Bottom sheets stay imperative via `showModalBottomSheet` — they aren't routes
- One top-level route per PRD flow; nested routes for sub-screens (Edit profile, Change password, Forgot password)

Invite links (US-024) must be reachable from a cold app launch AND from a web landing → app handoff. Use Android App Links (Phase 1) + Universal Links (Phase 2).

---

## Backend

**Decision: Supabase.** Locked 2026-05-25.

Service mapping:

| Need | Supabase product |
|------|------------------|
| Email + password auth, Apple SSO, Google SSO, password reset | **Supabase Auth** (`supabase_flutter` package) |
| Persistent storage (users, chats, messages, invite links) | **Supabase Postgres** with Row-Level Security (RLS) |
| Real-time chat transport (US-015, US-016) | **Supabase Realtime** — Postgres change streams + Broadcast channels for typing/presence (if added later) |
| Avatar uploads (US-011) | **Supabase Storage** |
| Invite link single-use + 48h TTL (FR-4) | Postgres table + RLS policy + edge function for token mint/validate |
| Push notifications (US-038, FR-29) | **FCM via Supabase Edge Function** trigger (Supabase has no native push) |

Conventions:
- One Supabase project per environment: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`.
- All tables get RLS on day one. No service-role keys shipped in the app — Flutter uses anon key only.
- Migrations live under `supabase/migrations/` (Supabase CLI). PR-reviewed; never edit prod via dashboard.
- Generate Dart types from the Postgres schema with `supabase gen types` → checked in under `lib/shared/models/db/`.

**Out of scope for backend (per PRD Non-Goals):** AI translation, language matching/discovery, payments, voice/video, group chats.

Translation + word lookup data (tappable word popups, FR-11) is **static dictionary content**, not AI. Bundle as JSON assets per language pair under `assets/dictionaries/`. No Supabase calls in the word-lookup path. No LLM calls anywhere.

---

## Design Fidelity

The prototype (`prototype.html`) is the visual + interaction reference. Translation rules:

| Prototype | Flutter |
|-----------|---------|
| `#5B4FE8` purple | `ThemeData.colorScheme.primary` |
| 375×780 phone shell | Real device safe areas — drop fixed dimensions |
| Inline `onclick` handlers | Widget callbacks, never global functions |
| DOM `display:none` toggling | Widget tree rebuilds via state |
| Bottom sheet `*Sheet` + `*Backdrop` | `showModalBottomSheet` (handles scrim) |
| Tappable word `<span>` | `RichText` + `TextSpan` with `TapGestureRecognizer` |
| Word popup clamped to phone bounds (FR-12) | `OverlayEntry` positioned via `CompositedTransformFollower` |
| SVG double-tick (gray → purple) | Custom `Icon` widget; animate color on read |
| Auto-growing textarea (US-023) | `TextField` with `maxLines: null` + `minLines: 1` |
| Long-press 500ms (US-019, US-020) | `GestureDetector(onLongPress: …)` |
| Date dividers ("Today") | Section headers in `ListView.builder` |

The prototype's `id`/class names are not API — don't carry them into Dart.

---

## Tooling

- **Lints:** `flutter_lints` (default) + opt into stricter rules incrementally
- **Formatting:** `dart format` enforced in pre-commit
- **Package manager:** `pub` (built in)
- **Build:** `flutter build apk` (debug), `flutter build appbundle` (release for Play Store)
- **Local run:** `flutter run -d <device-id>`; list devices via `flutter devices`

---

## Testing

- **Unit tests:** `flutter_test`, one file per non-trivial pure-Dart unit
- **Widget tests:** golden tests for hero screens (auth, chat list, chat view) once design is locked
- **Integration tests:** `integration_test` package — cover the 4 PRD flows end-to-end (sign up → invite → join → chat)
- Acceptance-criteria checklists in `prd-blab.md` map 1:1 to integration test cases

---

## Internationalization

- `flutter_localizations` + ARB files under `lib/l10n/`
- Interface language list = the 11 languages in `prd-blab.md` § Languages Supported
- **Interface language** (chrome strings) is distinct from **learning language** (chat content). Don't conflate them.

---

## CI / Release

Not yet set up. When added:
- GitHub Actions: `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, `flutter build apk` on PRs
- Internal track on Google Play for dogfooding before public release

---

## Crash Reporting + Observability

**Decision: Sentry** (`sentry_flutter`). Locked 2026-05-25.

- Initialize in `main.dart` before `runApp`; wrap with `SentryFlutter.init` runner.
- Capture: unhandled errors, Flutter framework errors, Dart isolate errors, network 5xx, performance traces for cold-start and chat-view first-paint.
- DSN per environment (dev / staging / prod) via build-time `--dart-define`.
- PII: scrub email + message bodies before send. User id only.
- Source maps / debug symbols uploaded on release builds via Sentry CLI step in CI.

## Resolved Decisions (log)

1. ✅ **State management:** Riverpod — locked 2026-05-25
2. ✅ **Backend:** Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Realtime + Storage + Edge Functions; FCM via edge function for push) — locked 2026-05-25
3. ✅ **Real-time transport:** Supabase Realtime (Postgres change streams) — locked 2026-05-25, follows from #2
4. ✅ **Crash reporting:** Sentry (`sentry_flutter`) — locked 2026-05-25
5. ✅ **Supabase project:** ref `bhzcexhebjszwyqvcsxs`, URL `https://bhzcexhebjszwyqvcsxs.supabase.co`, publishable key shipped in `lib/shared/data/supabase_config.dart` (anon/publishable keys are client-safe by design; row-level security on every table enforces access) — locked 2026-05-25
6. ✅ **Typography:** system fonts only (Roboto on Android, SF Pro on iOS). No custom typeface. Lighter app weight, no licensing, theme already uses the system stack. — locked 2026-05-28
7. ✅ **Brand color direction:** orange `#D4694A` is the long-term brand color; purple `#5B4FE8` stays as in-app UI primary until full brand-guidelines pass swaps everything in one shot. Icon + splash already orange. — locked 2026-05-28
8. ✅ **Privacy posture (Signal-style symmetric toggles):** Typing indicators and Read receipts ship as per-user toggles, both default ON, both symmetric (OFF = client never broadcasts the event AND user does not see partner's). Online / "last seen" presence is **not built as a feature at all** (no toggle, no opt-out, simply absent). Key recovery scheme deferred to V2 — V1 = reinstall wipes history. Full posture in PRD § Privacy posture. — locked 2026-05-28
9. ✅ **Supabase region:** EU (Frankfurt — `eu-central-1`). GDPR-aligned with our privacy positioning. Will verify current project region; switch if it lives outside EU. — locked 2026-05-28
10. ✅ **Edit / delete time windows:** Edit = 24h from send time (Signal-style); after that the Edit row is hidden from the long-press sheet. Delete = no time limit, sender can delete any sent message at any time, propagates to recipient. — locked 2026-05-28
11. ✅ **TTS source:** V1 on-device only (Flutter TTS via OS engines). Disabled state = icon dim 40%, no tap, no tooltip, no text. V2 evaluate cloud TTS / recorded human audio for languages where on-device quality is weak (Tamil, Ukrainian, Hindi). — locked 2026-05-28
12. ✅ **Multiple language exchanges per user:** Yes, per-chat. Each chat row owns its `learning_language_code` + `teaching_language_code`. Profile hero shows the "primary" (most-active) as a hint. — locked 2026-05-28
13. ✅ **Invite link policy:** Valid until a single *successful* claim, within a 48h TTL. Multiple clicks before claim are allowed. Once claimed, link returns "already claimed" state (US-037). — locked 2026-05-28
14. ✅ **Interface-language behavior:** Switch refreshes existing chat translations + word popups immediately. No app restart. Translation lookups must be re-rendered, not cached against the old interface language. — locked 2026-05-28
15. ✅ **Log-out UX:** Confirm dialog before sign out ("Log out?" / Cancel + Log out). Signal pattern. — locked 2026-05-28

## Open Decisions

Still need a call. Surface them, don't silently choose.

1. **Word lookup data source:** bundled JSON per language pair (proposed) vs static CDN vs lightweight API
2. **Analytics:** none vs PostHog vs Supabase log queries only
3. **iOS-native feel on Android:** all-purple + Cupertino-style across both platforms (proposed) vs Material on Android / Cupertino on iOS

PRD § Open Questions are product questions, distinct from these — keep them separate.
